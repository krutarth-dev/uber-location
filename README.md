# uber-location

In this code, we performed the following steps to evaluate the accuracy of our model:

1. Visualizing Clustering Results: We plotted the longitude and latitude of the booking data points using `plt.scatter()`. The points were colored based on the assigned clusters obtained from our model. This visualization helps us understand the grouping of high booking areas.

2. Evaluating Accuracy: We calculated the accuracy of our model using the `calculate_accuracy()` function. The accuracy metric depends on the specific task and can be customized accordingly. It compares the predicted labels (clusters) with the true labels (if available) and provides an assessment of how well our model performed.

By visualizing the clustering results and calculating the accuracy, we can gain insights into the effectiveness of our model in identifying high booking areas and assess its overall performance. This information can be used to demonstrate the model's quality and make informed decisions about its deployment or further improvements.
